# DATA-PREDICTION-PYTHON-


Daily Expense Prediction
Description
This project uses data science techniques to predict daily expenses based on a database containing 300 records of expenses. The project is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, and numpy.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
numpy
You can install these dependencies with pip:

pip install pandas sklearn matplotlib numpy

Usage
To use this project, first import your data into an Excel file named ‘A00835903_Registro_Datos.xlsx’. Make sure your data is in the correct columns.

Then, simply run the Python script. The script will train a linear regression model with your data and then predict your future expenses. It will also generate a graph comparing actual and predicted costs.

In addition, the script will provide a summary of your activities, including the total number of activities, maximum and minimum budget, cost summary by activity type, total unique days, total expenses, total savings, and daily savings.
